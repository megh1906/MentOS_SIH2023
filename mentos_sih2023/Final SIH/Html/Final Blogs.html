                    <h1>How We Glamorize Mental Illness - And What We Can Do About It</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>It's safe to say I talk about mental illness more than the average person (okay,
                        much more than the average person), which means I can get so focused on specifics and details
                        that I
                        miss things that are outside my scope. Over the years, mental illness has become more and more
                        glamorized and honestly, I missed parts of it. I mostly ignored this content because I thought I
                        knew what the causes were, but it's much more complicated than I'd anticipated. So today I'd
                        like to
                        address one aspect of why it's dangerous to glamorize mental illness - and how easily it can be
                        perpetrated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Early on in my mental health journey, I was constantly doing research on Google. I wanted to
                        learn
                        about what I was feeling - symptoms, causes, treatment, etc. I was reading other people's
                        experiences and seeing myself in their stories about feeling sad and overwhelmed. But I was also
                        putting in searches like 'how to make my depression go away' and 'what's good about depression'
                        and
                        that's where I saw my first obstacle in the way of mental <br>
                        <br>
                        I found so much content that said that depression is more common in creatives, that it creates
                        pain
                        that we can use as fuel for our work, and it impacted me in that early state. I saw my
                        depression as
                        poetic, as necessary for my struggle. The more I lived with depression, the more I would be able
                        to
                        use this pain and do something noteworthy. But let me be clear - I WAS SO DAMN WRONG. The
                        “tortured
                        genius” trope in media is toxic for people with mental health conditions, and has persisted for
                        years. Mental illness is often used as a footnote in someone's success story, e.g. “they
                        overcame
                        their struggle with X to become the Next Big Thing.” We treat mental illness as something to
                        overcome, or a game to win. That creates an attitude that makes people feel like they need to
                        'beat'
                        mental illness, but never to manage it.<br>
                        <br>
                        Unhealthy coping mechanisms and a reactionary approach to mental health are two other reasons
                        for
                        this continued glamorization. We all have some coping mechanisms that aren't the healthiest (I
                        include myself in that), but avoidance to connect those coping mechanisms with a possible
                        struggle
                        means that people are often struggling and will try to place the blame on anything but mental
                        illness. Our reactionary nature also means that we're discussing mental illness after the fact,
                        instead of having a more honest discussion about how we got there in the first place.<br>
                        <br>
                        Despite the incredible conversations I have with folks and an improved portrayal of mental
                        illness
                        in the media, I know millions of people in America see mental illness as a weakness. The only
                        upside
                        of this weakness, it seems, is that it can be the backstory for our success. But mental illness
                        isn't only reserved for the most successful and respected - remember, it doesn't discriminate!
                        That's why I don't say that I “struggle with depression.” I am not a tortured genius. I am not
                        here
                        to overcome depression or conquer anxiety (though maybe one day it won't be so debilitating!). I
                        live with mental illness, and I'm just doing the best I can. And you know what? That's more than
                        enough.

                    <h1>Our stress and relaxation responses: What you need to know</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Your stress response behaves badly and you've come to understand why. Great first step, but now
                        it's time to pull in the reins. And to do it you need to learn about your relaxation response.
                        Let's get busy…</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We began a two-part series last week on our stress and relaxation responses.
                        Part one handled our stress response (fight/flight) and we'll wrap things up by digging into our
                        relaxation response.
                        As I said last week, most everything you're about to read comes from a great book written by
                        Gregg D. Jacobs, PhD, Say Good Night to Insomnia.
                        Here we go…</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The discovery of the relaxation response
                        Prior to the 1960s, voluntary control over the autonomic nervous system (ANS) - in charge of our
                        respiration rate, heart rate, digestion, etc. - was thought impossible.
                        But later that same decade some significant discoveries in the world of biofeedback challenged
                        that notion. And scientists soon discovered control over the ANS could be achieved.
                        Seems the biofeedback outcomes were so impressive, scientists began studying other ANS-managing
                        mind/body techniques, such as meditation and relaxation.
                        Dr. Herbert Bnson
                        Dr. Jacobs' mentor, Dr. Herbert Benson, was one of the first scientists to conduct research on
                        biofeedback, meditation, and relaxation techniques.
                        After years of research, Benson was impressed by the fact that each of these techniques produced
                        the same physiological quieting response.
                        He called it the relaxation response.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        What is the relaxation response?
                        Benson proposed that the relaxation response (RR) is our body's inborn counter-balancing
                        mechanism to the stress response and can be used to offset its damaging effects.
                        It's crucial to keep in mind that the RR occurs automatically when it comes to physical
                        stressors; however, such is not the case with psychological stressors.
                        That means we have to learn to consciously initiate the RR to counter the effects of excessive
                        stress responses.
                        Is it any wonder that the RR is an effective intervention for all sorts of health concerns -
                        anxiety disorders, hypertension, chronic pain, GI issues, blood sugar stabilization, a
                        vulnerable immune system, insomnia, menopausal hot flashes, and more?
                        How to turn on the relaxation response
                        Dr. Benson could have left his work in the discovery process and it would have been “job well
                        done.” However, he went on to define the four elements necessary to elicit the RR…
                        A quiet place with eyes closed to minimize distractions
                        A comfortable position and muscular relaxation
                        A mental focusing device such as breathing, a word, or an image to shift the mind away from
                        distracting thoughts
                        Passive disregard of everyday thoughts
                        So with that foundation, according to Benson and Jacobs, here's what it takes to turn on the RR…
                        Relax the muscles throughout your body: Lying down or sitting comfortably, close your eyes and
                        feel relaxation gradually spreading. What you're looking for are feelings such as warmth,
                        heaviness, tingling, floating - or nothing.
                        Establish a relaxed and abdominal breathing pattern.
                        Direct your attention from everyday thoughts by using a mental focusing device that's neutral
                        and repetitive. Jacobs suggests words such as one, relax, peace, heavy. For many, it's helpful
                        to repeat the word silently with each exhaled breath. The mental focusing device can also be a
                        visual image - a vacation spot, floating on a cloud, or a place of your creation.
                        Have you ever done it? Do you hurt badly enough to give it a try?</p>
